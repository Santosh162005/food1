| **Instance Type** | Free |

### C. Add Environment Variables

## Step 3: Get Google Gemini API Key

1. Go to https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey
2. Click **"Create API Key"**
3. Copy the key
4. Add it to Render environment variables:
   - Go to your service â†’ **Environment**

## Important Notes

### Database
- Using **SQLite** (file-based database)
- Data persists on Render's free tier
- For production, consider upgrading to PostgreSQL

### File Uploads
- Images upload to `static/uploads/`
- Free tier has limited disk space
- Consider using cloud storage (Cloudinary, AWS S3) for production

### Free Tier Limitations
- Spins down after 15 minutes of inactivity
- First load after inactivity takes ~30 seconds
- 750 hours/month free (enough for 24/7 usage)

---

## Troubleshooting

### Build Failed?
- Check build logs in Render dashboard
- Ensure all dependencies in requirements.txt
- Try changing Python version to 3.11.0

### App Not Loading?
- Check application logs
- Verify environment variables are set
- Ensure start command is: `gunicorn app_sqlite:app`

### OCR Not Working?
- Tesseract may not work on free tier
- Consider disabling OCR or upgrading instance

---

## Upgrade to MySQL (Optional)

If you want to use MySQL instead of SQLite:

1. **Create MySQL Database** (Render doesn't offer free MySQL)
   - Use external service like PlanetScale (free tier)
   - Or upgrade Render instance

2. **Update app configuration**
   - Rename `app.py` (MySQL version) 
   - Update start command to: `gunicorn app:app`
   - Add database credentials to environment variables

---

## Monitoring & Maintenance

- **View Logs**: Render Dashboard â†’ Your Service â†’ Logs
- **Check Status**: Dashboard shows deployment status
- **Auto-Deploy**: Enabled by default when you push to GitHub
- **Custom Domain**: Available on paid plans

---

## Cost

- **Free Tier**: $0/month
  - 750 hours/month
  - Spins down after inactivity
  - Limited resources

- **Paid Tier**: $7/month
  - Always on
  - More resources
  - Custom domains
